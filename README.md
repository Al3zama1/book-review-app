## Introduction
Developed a fully tested book review application where users can add new books and write or see reviews posted by 
different users. The aim of the project is to master testing techniques for effectively carrying out unit,
integration, and end-to-end testing following a test driven development (TDD) approach.

The project gave me the opportunity to explore testing recipes for the different layers of an application such as
database, messaging, and HTTP communication. Furthermore, I got to work with the different testing slices provided by Spring
and create a custom application context to carry out integration tests with the help of LocalStack. Finally, Testcontainers
formed a critical part of this project because it allowed me to spawn up the necessary infrastructure needed like database,
and AWS SQS support to perform integration tests.

## Application Architecture
- Keycloack (Open source identity and access management solution) to secure parts of the frontend and backend.
- PostgreSQL (RDBMS) to store data in a relational database.
- Amazon SQS (Simple Queuing Service) for asynchronous message processing.
- Spring Boot backend with Java
- Dependency on a remote REST API for fetching book information.
- Single page application frontend with React and Typescript
